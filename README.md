# XINU (Operating Systems Labs)
During the Spring semester of my Junior year I built up the XINU operating system from its original state to one that includes 
many interesting features such as callback functions, ROP attacks, inter-process communication via message queues, etc. 

My lab reports are attached in certain commits under ~\system\ where you may view them.

I succeeded immensely in my operating systems class and I am glad I can show off my rendition of XINU.
